This repo was created to practice fetching data from an API and using the [map](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_map.asp) and [filter](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_filter.asp) methods to display the desired data. 

1) I fetched the data from https://pro.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/hourly?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}, using my API key. 

2) I then used the map function to convert the temperatures to farenheight from kelvin.

3) I then used the filter function to calculate the percentage of sunny weather within the last four days.
